	This is my favorite trail mix for a long day of biking. It stores well, is lightweight and can give you a great energy boost!

	If I know I'm going to be going our for a full day on the trail, I want to make sure that I've got a good source of energy to help me make it through those really tough climbs. Many of my friends love the pre-packaged energy bars, but in my opinion nothing beats a well thought-out trail mix! The great thing about trail mix is that you can modify it to your specific tastes, so if you don't like some of the ingredients listed here, play around and find your perfect mix! There are days where I find the wasabi peas to be too much, so I usually make one batch with them, and one batch without them so I can pack for whatever mood I'm in. Good trail mix is about exploring, don't be afraid to substitute your own ingredients!

    Not my favorite mix, I love walnuts and cashews, and this just has peanuts. Good start though!

    Love this mix! I usually skip the wasabi peas, but other than that this is a perfect blend of salty and sweet!

    Nice! I love a good bag of trail mix when out riding! Never would have thought of the pumpkin seeds!
